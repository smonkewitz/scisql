    Inputs:
        ids        Existing id range list or 0. If this argument is null,
                   a fresh range list is allocated and returned. If it is
                   non-null, all its entries are removed, but its memory is
                   re-used. This can be used to avoid malloc/realloc costs
                   when this function is being called inside of a loop.
        center     Center of circle, must be a unit vector.
        radius     Circle radius, degrees.
        level      Subdivision level, [0, SCISQL_HTM_MAX_LEVEL].
        maxranges  Maximum number of ranges to return. When too many ranges
                   are generated, the effective subdivision level of HTM ids
                   is reduced. Since two consecutive ranges that cannot be
                   merged at level L may become mergable at level L-n, this
                   "coarsening" cuts down on the number of ranges (but makes
                   the range list a poorer approximation to the input
                   geometry). Note that for arbitrary input geometry, up to
                   4 ranges may be generated no matter what the subdivision
                   level is. So for maxranges < 4, the requested bound may
                   not be achieved.

    Return:
        A list of HTM ID ranges for the HTM triangles overlapping the given
        circle. A null pointer is returned if center == 0 or level is not in
        the range [0, SCISQL_HTM_MAX_LEVEL], or if an internal memory
        (re)allocation fails.

        Note that the input range list may be reallocated (to grow its
        capacity), and so the input range list pointer may no longer point to
        valid memory. Always replace the input pointer with the return value
        of this function!

        If a memory (re)allocation fails, this function will free the memory
        associated with the range list (even it came from a non-null input
        pointer).

        A pointer to a scisql_ids struct can be cleaned up simply by passing
        it to free().
